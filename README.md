# Java Practice Questions 🚀

This repository is a **personal Java and DSA question bank** that I (Pavan) practiced thoroughly as part of my **placement and interview preparation**. Every folder and file here represents problems I've solved and concepts I've mastered through consistent coding.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

I didn't just collect questions — I solved them.

✅ Wrote Java code from scratch  
✅ Practiced each concept until I was confident  
✅ Followed topic-wise structured learning  
✅ Focused on commonly asked interview questions  
✅ Improved time and space complexity awareness
